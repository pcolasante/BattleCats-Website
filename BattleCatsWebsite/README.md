Demonstration of Web Design for Capstone Course

This is meant to show my personal work in Front-End and Back-End Web Development during my final year in my A.S. Information Technology degree.
Improvements are always able to be made since this is my first real website and hopefully the repository will be updated even after my course is done.

Thanks for showing some interest in this project!

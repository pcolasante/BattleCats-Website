# BattleCats-Website
IT Capstone Course (CIS 2910C) Project: Creating a Computing Electronics E-Commerce Website using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP

An assignment done with the BattleCats team in the course, in which we all contributed to the project to fully realize and upload the website. This included database deployment, front-end and back-end development, etc. My role in the project was the research and compiling of computer products to fill the database, that would later be implemented in the website as Product Information. Furthermore, I was in charge of providing the images, researching, cleaning, and resizing said images in order to minimize the bugs that could occur at the time of upload. In the meantime, I was able to support my members through the back-end and later the front-end development as I checked for errors and provided recommendations as needed.
